I am a 1st year Computer Science Ph.D. student in Georgia Institute of Technology, advised by Prof. Celine Lin.

Research
======
I am exploring the application of large language models (LLMs) to speed up and lower the entrance barrier of hardware design. This includes automatic generation of RTL for various hardware designs.
